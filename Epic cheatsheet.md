# Epic cheatsheet by [Stijn Janssen IT courses](https://www.stijnjanssen.nl)

## General tips
A.I. is a tool, not an all-in-one solution
Know what you want / need
Be as specific as possible

## Prompting for text
Use full length sentences, A.I. is trained on learning full sentences, not keywords
Use English as prompting language
Ask for English as output language
Add sample input data if you want to explain your use case better
Add sample data like files if you need a structured output
When using the API, configure the structured output feature

## Prompting for images and video
Use English as prompting language
Use A.I. to generate well formed descriptions and adjectives
Be extremely detailed
If you want to add texts, depending on the A.I. you're using, write the texts between double quotes; "this is a text".
Don't be afraid to use technical descriptions
Mention camera angles
Mention lighting effects
Mention shutter timing and ISO values
Mention diafragma
Mention image ratios
Mention colours, hexcodes will (often) not work
You can replace technical descriptions with well written descriptions as well;
- "dramatic lighting", "hyper detailed, ultra sharp", "high fantasy"
If you can 'click' on a button that adds a property, choose that over typing it in your prompt
You can even mention camera brands and types, where it's fingers crossed if the A.I. has knowledge of images that had a description of that camera as well.
Don't be afraid to describe emotions
Either describe the visual effect of an emotion in extreme detail, or just name the emotion and let A.I. get all the accompanying effects.

## Prompting for audio
Use English as prompting language
Mention musical style(s)
